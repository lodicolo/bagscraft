# BagsCraft

This is a repository following along [b3agz][gh-b3agz]'s "[Code a Game Like Minecraft in Unity][yt-playlist]" tutorial series on YouTube, but in Godot 4.3 instead of Unity.

Code for each video is stored in separate branches in this repository:
- [01 - The First Voxel][gh-01]
- [02 - The First Chunk][gh-02]
